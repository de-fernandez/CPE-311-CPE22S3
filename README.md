    <h3 align = "center"> About Me </h3>
    <div class = "Description"> Hi! I am Don Eleazar T. Fernandez, a student enrolled in the Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering (BSCPE) program. I took up the Data Science track elective to test myself on what more I could do, despite my weakness to code. Also, I see that Data Science has more potential for career opportunities than the other track electives, as some of them are less established in the industry or face higher competition. In my free time, I play both League of Legends and Mobile Legends, and watch random videos on YouTube. </div>
